What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- I get a message that tells me that a new Git repository has been 
initialized. If I didn't do this, I wouldn't be able to use Git 
within this repo

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- It gives you a place to assemble your commit before you actual have 
to "commit" to the commit.
