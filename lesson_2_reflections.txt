What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- I get a message that tells me that a new Git repository has been 
initialized. If I didn't do this, I wouldn't be able to use Git 
within this repo

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- It gives you a place to assemble your commit before you actual have 
to "commit" to the commit. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- It will allow you to only place the files in the repository that are 
necessary for the logical change that occured. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

- They would allow you to make multiple versions of the same file that
you could maintain all at one time. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

- They help by showing me which commit exists in which location. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

- You end up with one branch that is named the same as the current
branch you were on when you make the merge. This means that the
previous branch can now be deleted, and that those changes were	completed.
