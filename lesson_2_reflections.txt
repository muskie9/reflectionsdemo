What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- I get a message that tells me that a new Git repository has been 
initialized. If I didn't do this, I wouldn't be able to use Git 
within this repo

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- It gives you a place to assemble your commit before you actual have 
to "commit" to the commit. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- It will allow you to only place the files in the repository that are 
necessary for the logical change that occured.
