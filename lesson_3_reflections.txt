When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- You could use a remote repository any time you want to commit your changes to GitHub to collaborate with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

- For the same reason you may not want to push changes you aren't 
ready to share. Sometimes there is a part of the project the community
is working on that you don't want to have cluttering up your local repo
until you are certain that you want to use it.
