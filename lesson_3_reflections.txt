When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- You could use a remote repository any time you want to commit your changes to GitHub to collaborate with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

- For the same reason you may not want to push changes you aren't 
ready to share. Sometimes there is a part of the project the community
is working on that you don't want to have cluttering up your local repo
until you are certain that you want to use it. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Branch: Happens on a single repo
- Cloning: Copy's an existing repository
- Forking: Exactly like a clone, but only exists within GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- You can always reference it when you have a merge conflict. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- I feel like you could set up a system that would work with folders
but GitHub makes it way easier to see and share changes while working
on one single project. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

- You can really try out anything in a different branch without 
interfereing with stuff other people could be working on. If you do
stuff directly in master, however, you can all collaborate on a the 
same thing at the same time.
