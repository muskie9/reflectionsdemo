How did viewing the diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- It helps make the problem space smaller
so you don't have to look through the entire file
before you find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- It would save time on reverting back to an old version of a file. 
It also would make debugging easier. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

- Pros: You control the version history, so you can save more logically.
- Cons: You could forget to commit, and thus not have a good history. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- Because software applications are more likely to involve multiple
files, whereas Google Docs users are only editing one file at a time. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- Git Log shows when each commit was made, and get diff shows what 
changed between the current commit and last commit.

make a change
make another change


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

- Because you can always find those changes easily and undo them. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- Some of my own projects!!!
